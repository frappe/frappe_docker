Everything about [Frappe](https://github.com/frappe/frappe) and [ERPNext](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext) in containers.

# Getting Started

To get started you need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), and [git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/set-up-git) setup on your machine. For Docker basics and best practices refer to Docker's [documentation](http://docs.docker.com).

Once completed, chose one of the following two sections for next steps.

### Try in Play With Docker

To play in an already set up sandbox, in your browser, click the button below:

<a href="https://labs.play-with-docker.com/?stack=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frappe/frappe_docker/main/pwd.yml">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/play-with-docker/stacks/master/assets/images/button.png" alt="Try in PWD"/>
</a>

### Try on your Dev environment

First clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/frappe/frappe_docker
cd frappe_docker
```

Then run: `docker compose -f pwd.yml up -d`

### To run on ARM64 architecture follow this instructions

After cloning the repo run this command to build multi-architecture images specifically for ARM64.

`docker buildx bake --no-cache --set "*.platform=linux/arm64"`

and then

- add `platform: linux/arm64` to all services in the pwd.yaml
- replace the current specified versions of erpnext image on `pwd.yml` with `:latest`

Then run: `docker compose -f pwd.yml up -d`

## Final steps

Wait for 5 minutes for ERPNext site to be created or check `create-site` container logs before opening browser on port 8080. (username: `Administrator`, password: `admin`)

If you ran in a Dev Docker environment, to view container logs: `docker compose -f pwd.yml logs -f create-site`. Don't worry about some of the initial error messages, some services take a while to become ready, and then they go away.
